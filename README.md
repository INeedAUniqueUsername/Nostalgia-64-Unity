# Nostalgia 64 (Unity)

![](Nostalgia64UnityPreview.png)

This project is an experimental space action demp with cold, hard zero-gravity motion. An attempted Godot remake is available at [Nostalgia 64 (Godot)](https://github.com/INeedAUniqueUsername/Nostalgia-64-Godot).

Currently there are 8 unique ships - all of them fully implemented and functional. There is zero user interface implemented.

Due to the difficulty of the gameplay, this game concept is not considered viable for further exploration.

# Nostalgia 64 (Unity)

![](Nostalgia64UnityPreview.png)

This project is the precursor to Nostalgia 64 (Godot). I abandoned it because I ran out of ideas and I dislike Unity3D.

Since this project is older, it has had a lot more work done on it. Currently there are 8 unique ships - all of them fully implemented and functional.
